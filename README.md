# PathFinding Project

## Motivation
During a road trip with friends, we noticed large areas of open green land on the GPS map and small towns scattered throughout the map, marked as a different color. We enjoyed the experience of traveling through these small towns and thought of making it a deliberate part of our trip. This project is an attempt to achieve that goal more intentionally.

While Google Maps API could be used for this purpose, I was interested in image reduction and learning more about image sampling. Therefore, I decided to work on this project as an opportunity to explore that interest.

## Inspiration
This project was also inspired by  [Pathfinding Visualizer Tutorial (software engineering project)]{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak&t=650s}
